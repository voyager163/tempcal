# Upgrading

**Warning**: When performing database migrations, you may lose data if the migration is not done properly.

1. Pull the current version:
   ```
   git pull
   ```
2. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

   (this can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:

   ```
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

3. Check the `.env.example` and compare it to your current `.env` file. In case there are any fields not present
   in your current `.env`, add them there.

   For the current version, especially check if the variable `BASE_URL` is present and properly set in your environment, for example:

   ```
   BASE_URL='https://yourdomain.com'
   ```

4. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
   For a production build, run for example:
   ```
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```
5. Enjoy the new version.
